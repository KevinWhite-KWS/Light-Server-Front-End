## Capabilities

* Google Blockly editor for visually creating arbtiarily complex LDL programs
* Save / load programs to / from the local file system for later editing
* Upload programs to one or more LDL servers

## Goal

Provide a tool which gives an convenient means of interacting with one or more LDL servers.  This tool is designed for power users.

## Where are we and what do we need to do?

The project is in an early prototype stage so there is a lot to do!

* Create production worthy code.
* Expand functionality to include ability to consume all LDL server endpoints visually.
* Make it generally more intuitive and easier to use.
