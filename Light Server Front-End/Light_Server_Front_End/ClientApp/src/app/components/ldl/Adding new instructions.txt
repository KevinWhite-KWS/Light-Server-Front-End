New instructions can be added to the set of instructions
by following this procedure:

1. Add a new enum value to the instruction-type enum for the new instruction.
2. Add a class for the instruction:
   Create a file in the instruction-class folder along the format of: instruction-{op-code}-{name}.ts.
   Implement the instruction by adding properties and state as appropiate.
3. Add an interface for the instruction:
   Create a .ts an .html file int he instructions-ui folder for the instructon.  It should be
   named in the format of: instruction-{op-code}-{name}.ts and (.html).
   Implement the UI for the instruction and store state changes in an instance of the class
   created in 1.
4. Add an encoder class for the instruction which is reponsible for serialization and deserailziation:
   Create a file int he encoders folder in the format of: instruction-{op-code}-{name}-encoder.ts
   Implement the encoder.
5. Add the encoder to the getInstructionEncoder factory method of the program-encoder.ts class.
6. Add metadata for the new instruction to the instructions collection in the instruction-service.ts
   file.
7. Add a new entry to the createInstructionInstance factory method of instruction-service.ts class.
7. Add a reference to the UI component in the program.component.html factory UI component.
8. Add a reference to the component in app.module.ts

Test and ensure the new instruction can be added to programs in the expected manner.
